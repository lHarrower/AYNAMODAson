# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive forensic audit of the existing AYNAMODA codebase and creating detailed design and implementation specifications. The goal is to transform the current messy state into a cohesive, premium fashion app that embodies "Confidence as a Service" through a Digital Zen Garden philosophy. The audit will identify structural issues, architectural patterns, code quality problems, and feature gaps, then provide a roadmap for creating a unified design system and implementation plan.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a lead AI engineer, I want to conduct a thorough forensic audit of the existing codebase, so that I can understand the current state and identify all structural, architectural, and quality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate and conflicting folders and files
2. WHEN examining the architecture THEN the system SHALL document the primary navigation system, state management solution, and overall code structure
3. WHEN assessing code quality THEN the system SHALL identify "God Components," hardcoded magic strings, inconsistent styling, and refactoring opportunities
4. WHEN evaluating feature completeness THEN the system SHALL assess how close the existing code is to implementing the full vision requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product designer, I want a comprehensive design system specification, so that the app can achieve the target aesthetic of "Spotify's clean structure," "Gucci's polished luxury," and "calm, premium wellness" feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the design system THEN it SHALL specify the unified color palette with warm off-white/cream (#F8F7F4), Polished Jade/Sage Green, and elegant Gold accents
2. WHEN creating typography rules THEN it SHALL define elegant Serif for headlines (Playfair Display) and clean Sans-serif for body text (Inter, Manrope)
3. WHEN establishing component standards THEN it SHALL specify spacing, shadows, border-radius, and interaction patterns for all core components
4. WHEN designing screen layouts THEN it SHALL define "Bento Box" grids for dashboards and collage-style overlapping cards for discovery screens
5. WHEN creating the design specification THEN it SHALL target the user emotion of "Huzur" (Serenity) and "Neşeli Lüks" (Joyful Luxury)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want a detailed, prioritized implementation plan, so that I can systematically transform the project from its current state to the finished premium fashion app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the task plan THEN it SHALL be organized into logical phases (Cleanup & Consolidation, Architectural Refactoring, Feature Completion)
2. WHEN defining Phase 1 tasks THEN it SHALL include deleting legacy/conflicting files and consolidating the design system
3. WHEN defining Phase 2 tasks THEN it SHALL include refactoring "God Components" into hooks and simpler presentational components
4. WHEN defining Phase 3 tasks THEN it SHALL prioritize missing features like Efficiency Score and Visual Onboarding Flow
5. WHEN structuring tasks THEN each SHALL be actionable, specific, and contribute to the core philosophy of "Confidence as a Service"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the audit to assess alignment with core features, so that I can ensure the implementation supports the anti-waste, pro-efficiency philosophy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating the onboarding flow THEN it SHALL assess visual-first upload capability for generating "Style DNA"
2. WHEN reviewing the home screen THEN it SHALL evaluate "Bento Box" dashboard implementation with daily inspiration and AI-curated outfits
3. WHEN examining the wardrobe feature THEN it SHALL assess grid-based digital closet with AI-powered automatic naming
4. WHEN analyzing the discover screen THEN it SHALL evaluate Tinder-style swipe interface with "Efficiency Score" calculation capability
5. WHEN reviewing the profile screen THEN it SHALL assess clean, list-based hub implementation for settings and preferences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want comprehensive documentation of current technical debt, so that I can prioritize cleanup efforts and ensure code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting technical debt THEN it SHALL identify all instances of code duplication and inconsistent patterns
2. WHEN analyzing component architecture THEN it SHALL flag components that violate single responsibility principle
3. WHEN reviewing styling approaches THEN it SHALL identify inconsistent theme usage and hardcoded values
4. WHEN examining state management THEN it SHALL document all global state patterns and potential conflicts
5. WHEN assessing file organization THEN it SHALL identify structural improvements needed for maintainability
