Ô£û Check Expo config for common issues
You have an app.json file in your project, but your app.config.ts is not using the values from it.
Advice:
Remove the static app.json, or use its values in your dynamic app.config.js. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration

Ô£û Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Expected package @expo/config-plugins@~10.1.1
Found invalid:
  @expo/config-plugins@9.0.12
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/config-plugins)
Expected package @expo/prebuild-config@~9.0.0
Found invalid:
  @expo/prebuild-config@8.0.17
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/prebuild-config)
Advice:
Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.

Ô£û Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.config.ts, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: scheme, plugins. 

Advice:
Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

Ô£û Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  No metadata available: @react-native-seoul/masonry-list, openai
Advice:
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
