# AYNA MODA Consolidated Environment Sample
# Annotated list of all environment variables referenced in the codebase.
# Columns (conceptual): NAME | Scope(public/secret) | Required(Y/N) | Purpose / Notes
# Public means safe to expose in client bundle (EXPO_PUBLIC_*). Secret means server/Edge only.

# --- Core Supabase (Client) ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= # public | Y | Supabase project REST/Realtime endpoint (used by client & edge)
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= # public | Y | Supabase anon key (RLS protected); treat as public but rotate if leaked

# --- Supabase Edge Function Runtime (Server Secrets in Supabase, not shipped) ---
SUPABASE_URL= # secret | Y | Injected into Edge functions (Deno) for server-side Supabase client
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= # secret | Y | Same value as anon key; still configure as secret in Functions
# (If service_role key ever needed, DO NOT expose to mobile; keep only in secure backend.)

# --- Google OAuth ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID= # public | Y | Web client ID for Google auth (used in AuthSession)
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID= # public | N | Native iOS client ID (optional if only web flow)
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID= # public | N | Native Android client ID (optional if only web flow)

# --- Sentry Monitoring ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN= # public | Recommended | Sentry DSN for error/crash reporting (public DSNs are safe)

# --- Weather API ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY= # public | Optional | OpenWeather (or compatible) API key â€“ enables live weather context

# --- Cloudinary (Unsigned Upload) ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME= # public | Y* | Cloud name for unsigned uploads (client constructs upload URL)
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET= # public | Y* | Unsigned upload preset permitting only expected transformations
# *If you migrate to signed uploads, move keys server-side and remove from public list.

# --- AI / Model Proxy ---
EXPO_PUBLIC_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN= # public | Optional | If directly calling HF models client-side (prefer proxy)
EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_AI_PROXY=true # public | Y | If true, route AI calls through protected Supabase Edge function
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY (server only) is configured in Supabase function secrets, not here.

# --- Optional Integrations (commented examples) ---
# EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
# EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY= # Strongly prefer proxy instead of shipping this
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=

# --- Runtime / Build Introspection (implicit) ---
# NODE_ENV is injected by tooling (development|production|test)
# EAS_BUILD_ID / EAS_BUILD_PROFILE / EAS_BUILD_GIT_COMMIT_HASH provided in build env (used in scripts)

# --- Notes ---
# 1. Keep a separate .env (local) and configure matching values in EAS secrets & Supabase project.
# 2. Never commit actual secret values; only sample placeholders.
# 3. After changes, re-run: npx expo config --type public to confirm exposure.
